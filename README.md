# Basic-decentralised-message-receiving-app
This app helps us to send a message by connecting our wallet and and at the cost of transaction fess (rinkeby network )) it sends the message to address of the app .
Here i have used the replit website to replicate the file structure from the buildspace instructor.
You will require hardhat and node js to be installed on your computer .
Hardhat helps you to put your samrt contract either on local blockchain or on a network(Rinkeby).{Note use Goerli network if you are creating this project after 5th october ,2022}

In this we will connect our frontend with the backent(smart contract or solidity code)
Create a directory on your local computer  and use hardhat to create a project in that folder by using CMD.
after the project is created a folder structure will be created with the pre required files .
Open VSCODE and start coding in solidity .
I have posted the required codes for the local files

Next up comes the Replit or frontend file structure 
I have added the files 
The html and css part can be designed according to your need.
